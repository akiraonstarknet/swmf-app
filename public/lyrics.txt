Verse 1:
Bitcoin's got the fire, but it's moving way too slow  
Ten-minute waits, high fees—but it's still the digital gold  
Scaling up the game, Starknet opens up the gate  
Transactions instant, fees so light  
Blazing through like neon lights!

Pre-Chorus:
No more waiting, no more pain
ZK magic scales the chain
Boosting Bitcoin, scaling Ethereum
Running fast at lightning speed

Chorus:
STARKNET WILL MELT FACES (x3)  
Brotherhood is real  
STARKNET WILL MELT FACES! (x2)  
The world will soon see!  

Beat Drop (Instrumental Hook)

Verse 2:
Thousand TPS, transactions fly!  
Dead cheap fees, we touch the sky!  
STARK-proof shield, security tight  
The tech is real, the future’s bright!  
200 mil STARK, locked in staked
Quantum-proofed, no trust to break
DeFi, Games and Art Peace
Starknet is the king—just wait and see!

Chorus:
STARKNET WILL MELT FACES (x4)  
Brotherhood is real  
STARKNET WILL MELT FACES! (x2)  
The world will soon see!  


Outro:
One blockchain, one dream
Scaling up, we’re supreme
Bitcoin, Ethereum, side by side
And now they’re chanting S-W-M-F

Ending (Soft Fade – Robotic Vocoder Line):
"Starknet’s here—scaling both Ethereum and Bitcoin, together."
